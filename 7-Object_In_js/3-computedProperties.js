// Computed properties in JavaScript let you create object properties automatically based on other values. They update themselves, so you donâ€™t have to set them manually. This makes it easier to handle dynamic data

let key1="name"
let key2="age"

let val1="abhay"
let val2=22

const obj={
    [key1]:val1,
    [key2]:val2
}
console.log(obj)

//Other way to compute
let obj1={}
obj1[key1]=val1
obj1[key2]=val2
console.log(obj1)
