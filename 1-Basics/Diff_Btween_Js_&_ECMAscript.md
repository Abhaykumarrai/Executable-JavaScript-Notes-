Original Documentation Of JavaScript => tc39(ECMAscript)
Documentation which we use => MDN

Always maintain code readability and it should be high
for that we can use pritter extention in vs code.




JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. Here are the key characteristics of its type system:
1-Type Flexibility: In JavaScript, you do not need to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. The type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable.
2-Type Checking: Type checking is done at runtime. This means that variables can be reassigned to values of different types without any errors
3-Implicit Conversion: JavaScript often performs implicit type conversion (also known as type coercion) when you perform operations on variables of different types.
