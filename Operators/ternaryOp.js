// The ternary operator in JavaScript is a shorthand conditional operator that takes three operands, allowing you to write concise conditional statements in the format:
// condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
// condition: The expression that evaluates to either true or false.
// expressionIfTrue: The value returned if the condition is true.
// expressionIfFalse: The value returned if the condition is false
